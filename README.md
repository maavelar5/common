# Simple *common* code that I use in most projects

I've been carrying around these pieces of codes from repo to repo... might as well just put it in one place, more stuff will be added with time.

- data_structures.hpp
  + A bunch of data structures that serves as a replacement for some STL stuff
- log.hpp
  + Logger
- utils.hpp
  + Colors, ascii file reader and spv file reader
- math_data.hpp
  + v2,v3,v4
  + mat4
  + ortho
  + perspective
- typedefs.hpp
  + Pretty self explanatory
- api.hpp
  + API function prototypes
- sdl_api.hpp
  + Implement api.hpp prototypes with SDL2
- ticks.hpp
  + Calculate frame based delta values
- testcases.hpp
  + Testcases for everything (right now only data structures and v2,3,4 being tested)
