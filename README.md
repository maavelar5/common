# Simple *common* code that I use in most projects

I've been carrying around these pieces of codes from repo to repo... might as well just put it in one place, more stuff will be added with time.

- dataStructures.hpp
  + A bunch of data structures that serves as a replacement for some STL stuff
- log.hpp
  + Logger
- utils.hpp
  + Colors, ascii file reader and spv file reader
- testcases.hpp
  + Testcases for everything (right now only data structures being tested)
